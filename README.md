## Description
- Our project is a web app for refugees who are settling in Canada. The app focuses on providing refugees information for resources such as clothing, shelter, food and community connections. It also tailors weather from their origin region, stories of hope and help and statistics all filtered by basic demographic information provided in a quiz.
